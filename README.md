<p>
For some reasons we have created 2 contact pages, one without css and one with css. At this moment, we only can link the index page to the without-css contact page, unfortunately we are unable to link the with-css contact page to our index.

Please click into the "jumbotron-narrow"folder" in order to review our beautifully designed contact page!
